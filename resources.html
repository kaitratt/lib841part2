<h1> School Resources</h1>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/CSS" href="project.css">
<p> Here are some great resources to help you out! I have divided them out based on topic. School resources will give you access to Class Dojo which what teachers use to communicate with parents and post updates on the class. The other link is to our school website where you can find upcoming events at school and have access to other the Enrichment Teachers Websites! Reading resources will give you links to different websites that have digital books to explore. I also have the school Librarian's Website linked as well for you to see her resources and what the students are working on in Library. Lastly, I have math resources for you to choose from. This includes Prodigy, which is a game the students enjoy playing. It has math problems specific to their needs and makes learning fun! There's also a link to Eureka! this is the math program we use in school for their learning. You can use this site to find extra resources to assist your children in their math learning! Don't forget to go to the contact page to reach out if you have any further questions!
