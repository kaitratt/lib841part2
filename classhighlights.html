<h1> Class Highlights</h1>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/CSS" href="project.css">
<p> Here are some highlights from the previous school year! We learned about different topics and units! My students really enjoyed our science units. 
<ul>
<li>In these photos you will see the winners of our Earthquake structure contests! We designed different buildings to see if they could survive an earthquake. Students studied different building types and used them for inspiration as they worked on their own projects.</li>
<li> At our school, we get to chose a mascot for our class. This year we were the Ratterman's Rattlesnakes! Here is a picture of us together at our first field day! We won tug o' war!</li>
<li> Lastly, the picture in the middle was from the last day of school. I have a tradition of buying my students sunglasses because their future is sooo bright all they need is shades!!</li>

</ul>
<br> These past 4 years I spent at Russell Cave Elementary teaching 4th grade. Now I'm heading to a new school in Franklin County called Collins Lane Elementary! I will be teaching 3rd grade. Stay tuned for new photots and updates as I start my new journey at a new school. Looking forward to trying new projects and seeing their growth throughout the school year!</body>
