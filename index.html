<h1> Kaitlyn's Personal Webpage</h1>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/CSS" href="project.css">
<p> Hi there! My name is Kaitlyn Ratterman and this is my <b> very first </b> webpage. I currently teach 4th grade and finishing up my 5th year of teaching. I am currently in the LMS degree program to combine my love of books and educating children. While working on my degree I will continue teaching and learning new things. I'm looking forward to incorporating my new knowledge from my degree program into my lessons at school! Readers become leaders and that's my mission for every student in my classroom!</p>

<h2> Facts about me </h2>
<p>I am from Versailles, KY. I have <b> two </b> dogs. Their names are <em> Jolene </em> and <em> Burley.</em> In my free time I like to read, spend time with my family, and be outside in the <strong> sun. </strong> On the weekdays you can catch me working with my wonderful students and being creative in the classroom. School is offically out so I will be spending my time doing the things I love while I prepare for a new and exciting school year!

<h3> Current obsessions</h3>
<p>Here are some current things I'm "nerding out" over. 
<ul>
<li> The tv show Below Deck on Bravo!</li>
<li> 7brew Energy drinks! Specifically the flavors I've found on their secret menu!</li>
<li> Books written by Freida McFadden</li>
<li> Giving myself "quiet time" to decompress and steady my mind.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Where am I getting my degree?</h4>
I am currently getting my degree at Eastern Kentucky University. This will be my 3rd degree and will give me my rank 1. What's <b>great</b> about this program is that it's 100% online. This means I can still work fulltime as an educator while continuing my studies here at EKU. <BR><u> EKU's library is fully online and has many features. This makes it easy to be an online student and have access to all the resources I need to be successful.</BR></u> Visit this awesome resource at <a href="https://libguides.eku.edu/library"> HTML EKU. </a>
